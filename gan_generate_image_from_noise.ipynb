    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "You are working with a team that is developing an online game where users travel to an alien planet and try to learn the language, culture, religion, and science of the planetary society. The game designers would like a set of characters to represent digits, different from any of those used on earth. To develop this set of characters, your job is to train a GAN on Arabic Handwritten digits and use it to create new symbols for representing digits on an alien planet.\n",

    "## Arabic Digits:\n",
    "Arabic digits correspond to Roman digits according to the table below (N.Das, A. Mollah, S. Saha, S. Haque, 2010, https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1891):"
